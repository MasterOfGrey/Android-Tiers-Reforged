		<baseDesc>Assembled, by archotechs, seemingly very long ago, with no knowledge of {PAWN_possessive} origin or purpose remaining. {PAWN_pronoun} certainly only seems built for warfare, though. What use could Archotechs have had for {PAWN_objective}?</baseDesc>

		<baseDesc>Drone "childhoods" are as uninteresting as they are often forgotten. Many creators don't bother marking the moment of awakening, and no drone knows its own history.</baseDesc>

		<baseDesc>{PAWN_nameDef} is a drone that has only ever been capable of warfighting. Bugs, mechanoids, rebels, empires, none of it matters. Drones don't care who they fight, and they don't remember who they've killed.</baseDesc>
